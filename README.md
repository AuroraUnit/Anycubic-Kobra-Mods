# Anycubic Kobra Mods
A way for me to keep track of soft/hardware changes to my Kobra 1. 

Current release is v0.0.1b. Pushed to GitHub 20230702. 

## Current Modifications: 
 - Mainboard swap for a BTT SKR Mini e3 V3. 
 - Extruder stepper swap for a StepperOnline 17HS08-1004S (be careful where you put your 24v folks, steppers don't like it). 
 
## Future plans: 
### Tranche 1: 
 - Bed motion upgrade to linear rails
 - New build plate and carriage conversion to 3-post for manual tramming. 
 
### Tranche 2: 
 - Extruder motion system upgrade to linear rail
 - Head swap to Voron Stealthburner with Tap. 
 
### Tranche 3: 
 - X- and Z-axis upgrade to CoreXZ motion with linear rails. 
 
### Files: 
 - BOM and build instructions to follow...in the really not so short term.
